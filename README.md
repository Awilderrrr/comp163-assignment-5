Why you chose each loop type for each challenge? In challenge 1 I used while loop. The number of iterations depends on the input and is unknown in advance. In challenge 2 I used for loop. To check if a number is prime, I had to test divisibility for all numbers from 2 to n-1. In challenge 3 I used for loop. I needed 1 loop for rows and another for the columns.

How your solutions work? In challenge 1 it prints the Collatz sequence from a starting integer down to 1. In challenge 2 it tells me whether an integer n ≥ 2 is prime by checking if any divisor from 2 to n-1 divides it evenly. In challenge 3 it produces a formatted 10×10 multiplication grid
